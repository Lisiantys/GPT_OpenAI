This is a web application that allows users to interact with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 text generation AI. With this application, you can define the behavior of the AI by providing it with a specific prompt, and then engage in conversations with it across different sessions.

Usage: 
OpenAI API Key: Before using the application, make sure you have a valid API key for OpenAI. You can get your own key at OpenAI API Keys.

Defining AI Behavior: Once you have your API key, paste it into the designated field on the application's homepage. If the key is valid, you'll be redirected to the main page of the application. Here, you can set the prompt that will dictate the AI's behavior in future conversations.

Engaging in Conversations: Once the prompt is set, you can start engaging in conversations with the AI by typing your messages into the input field provided. Press the "Send" button to send your message. The AI will respond based on the defined prompt and previous interactions.

Managing Conversations: You can manage your conversations using the list of available conversations. You can toggle between different conversations by clicking on the corresponding buttons.

Notes :
Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and properly configured.
Conversations are saved locally, so you can resume an interrupted conversation later.
